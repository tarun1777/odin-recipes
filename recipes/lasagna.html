           <h2>Description</h2>
           <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering flat pasta sheets with rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and cheese. To prepare it, cook ground beef or sausage with onions, garlic, and tomato sauce until thick and flavorful. Separately, make a bechamel sauce by whisking butter, flour, and milk until smooth. Pre-cook lasagna noodles if needed.</p>
           <p>In a baking dish, layer meat sauce, noodles, béchamel, and shredded mozzarella or parmesan cheese. Repeat the layers, finishing with cheese on top. Bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for about 30-40 minutes until golden and bubbling. Let it rest before serving for best results.</p>
